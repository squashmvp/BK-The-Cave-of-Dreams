Waterfall SFX

Two structs work together to create this effect.
The sound is accompanied by the visual effect of
splashing water. This visual effect and sfx take
place between these two structs.

One can visualize it like a rope tied tightly at
two ends. The ends are the structs, the rope is the
effect.

I do not know if one needs to be on a specific side
but I always place 2f on the left side and 30 on the 
right side of where water meets the ground; they can go
anywhere on a model as far as I can tell. You can only have 
one within a scene but you can have any many in 
the game as you would like. (Did not test 5 or more in one game)

Below is the information I used to create the structs.
Using Banjo's Backpack, it should be easy to tell which number goes where.
My reference for this information was the big waterfall in Spiral Mountain.

Struct 1
Object ID: 2f Script: 190c
b10-b17(In Order): 0, 0, 0, 0, b, 50

Struct 2
Object ID: 30 Script: 190c
b10-b17(In Order): 0, 0, 0, 0, b, 60

Step 1- Create 2 Waterfall Sound Emitters from menu.
Step 2- Replace data in side bar using above information.
Step 3- Save and Test for visual/audio effect.
