Banjo-Kazooie: The Cave of Dreams

A Bear and a Bird are looking for an Orange.

Thanks for playing this romhack.

You need to have the original rom in order to play this. You take that rom, and 
you patch it with the xdelta file included in this repository.
Here's an online patcher-

Contact me if you need assistance.

Notes:
  Make sure to experiment with the controls as much as possible when you begin.
  Especially the camera controls. R is a pretty good button.

  You need 300 notes to access the 50 note door secret. The note doors in Grand
  Piano do not have a requirement.
  
  Cheato gives you a description of the levels and their whole deal.
  
  If you fall in Grand Piano, don't ground pound so you don't lose your notes.
  
**Bugs and Stuff**
